# ClassificationModeling

In the topic of digital marketing, effective engagement on social media platforms like Facebook is crucial. This analysis focused on understanding how different types of content (photos, videos, texts) resonate with users in Thailand. Leveraging data-driven techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering, I transformed user interactions into key metrics that define engagement levels and emotional responses.

This analysis revealed that photos are the most engaging content type, leading in 'Likes' reactions, indicating a strong visual appeal. Whereas videos are mainly dominant in receiving 'Love' and 'Wow' reactions, suggesting their impact in capturing user interest. Text posts, although only having a few strong emotional reactions, serve their niche effectively.

Further, through classification modeling, I identified the typical characteristics of content within each cluster, providing insights into what drives user engagement and the emotional undercurrents of reactions. Crucially, I assessed the accuracy of predictive models to minimize false positives and negatives misclassifications that could lead to ineffective targeting and missed opportunities.

For businesses, these insights are critical. They highlight the significance of aligning content to audience preferences, investing in high-quality visuals and understanding the balance between reaching out and overstepping, thereby optimizing resource allocation and maximizing market potential. This analysis provides a strategic roadmap for engaging with the digital landscape in Thailand, with potential to being applied to broader markets.
